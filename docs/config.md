## Configuration Explanation

Here's a full explanation on the config file, if you want to have a deep dive on it

### Root config

This is the root json object in the config files

```json
{
    "enabled": true,
    "debug": false,
    "storage_root": "./pb_files",
    
    // Subconfigs. See the following sections
    "command": {/* Command config */},
    "server": {/* Server config */},
    "backup": {/* Backup config */},
    "scheduled_backup": {/* Scheduled backup config */},
    "prune": {/* Prune config */},
    "database": {/* Database config */}
}
```

#### enabled

The switch of the plugin. Set to false to disable the plugin

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

#### debug

The debug switch. Set to true to enable debug logging

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

#### storage_root

The root directory for Prime Backup to store all data files

The path is related to the work directory of MCDR. By default, the root directory will be `/path/to/mcdr_root/pb_files`

- Type: `str`
- Default: `"./pb_files"`

---

### Command config

```json
{
    "prefix": "!!pb",
    "permission": {
        "abort": 1,  
        "back": 2,
        "confirm": 1,
        "database": 4,
        "delete": 2,
        "delete_range": 3,
        "export": 4,
        "list": 1,
        "make": 1,
        "prune": 3,
        "rename": 2,
        "show": 1,
        "tag": 3
    },
    "confirm_time_wait": "1m",
    "backup_on_restore": true,
    "restore_countdown_sec": 10
}
```

#### prefix

The prefix of all Prime Backup commands in MCDR. Normally you don't need to change it

- Type: `str`
- Default: `"!!pb"`

#### permission

Minimum required [MCDR permission level](https://mcdreforged.readthedocs.io/en/latest/permission.html) for all subcommands

It's a mapping that maps from string to integer, storing permission level requirements for all subcommands.
If a subcommand is not in the mapping, it will use level 1 as the default permission requirement

For example, in the default config, `"back"` is mapped to `2`, 
which means that the `!!pb back` command requires permission level >= 2 to execute

- Type: `Dict[str, int]`

#### confirm_time_wait

Some of the MCDR commands requires user to enter `!!pb confirm` to continue.
This config defines the maximum time wait for those commands

When time exceeds, the command will be cancelled

- Type: [`Duration`](#duration)
- Default: `"1m"`

#### backup_on_restore

If an automatically backup should be made before restoring the world to a given backup. These automatic backups are the "pre-restore backups"

This is a safeguard prepared for those idiot users

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `true`

#### restore_countdown_sec

The duration in seconds of the countdown during backup restoring, before closing the Minecraft server

- Type: `int`
- Default: `10`

---

### Server config

Options on how to interact with the Minecraft server

```json
{
    "turn_off_auto_save": true,
    "commands": {
        "save_all_worlds": "save-all flush",
        "auto_save_off": "save-off",
        "auto_save_on": "save-on"
    },
    "saved_world_regex": [
        "^Saved the game$",
        "^Saved the world$"
    ],
    "save_world_max_wait": "10m"
}
```

#### turn_off_auto_save

If the autosave should be turned off before making a backup

Since turning off autosave provide a consistent view to the Minecraft world files, it's suggested to set this option to `true`

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `true`

#### commands

A set of Minecraft commands to be used by Prime Backup. Current they're only used during a backup creation

Timing of what Prime Backup will do during a backup creation

1. Turn off autosave with command stored in subconfig `auto_save_off`, if config [`turn_off_auto_save`](#turn_off_auto_save) is true
2. Save all worlds with command stored in subconfig `save_all_worlds`
3. Wait until all words are saved, i.e. the server outputs matches one of the regex in config [`saved_world_regex`](#saved_world_regex)
4. Create the backup
5. Turn on autosave with command stored in subconfig `auto_save_on`, if config [`turn_off_auto_save`](#turn_off_auto_save) is true

#### saved_world_regex

A list of regular expressions for identifying whether the server has already saved the world

- Type: `List[re.Pattern]`

#### save_world_max_wait

The maximum waiting time to before world saving is complete during backup creation

- Type: [`Duration`](#duration)
- Default: `"10m"`

---

### Backup config

Configs on how the backup is made

```json
{
    "source_root": "./server",
    "targets": [
        "world"
    ],
    "ignored_files": [
        "session.lock"
    ],
    "hash_method": "xxh128",
    "compress_method": "zstd",
    "compress_threshold": 64
}
```

#### source_root

The root directory where the backup / restore operations happen

Usually this should be the [working_directory](https://mcdreforged.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#working-directory) of MCDR, 
i.e. the `server` directory by default

- Type: `str`
- Default: `"./server"`

#### targets

The target files / directories to make backups

Usually you need to add the name(s) of your world folder(s) here

For example, for bukkit-like servers that split the world dimensions, you might want to use:

```json
"targets": [
    "world",
    "world_nether",
    "world_the_end"
]
```

- Type: `List[str]`

#### ignored_files

A list of file names to be ignored during backup. It contains `session.lock` by default 
to solve the backup failure problem caused by `session.lock` being occupied by the server in Windows

If the name string starts with `*`, then it will ignore files with name ending with specific string, 
e.g. `*.test` makes all files ends with `.test` be ignored, like `a.test`

If the name string ends with `*`, then it will ignore files with name starting with specific string, 
e.g. `temp*`  makes all files starts with `temp` be ignored, like `tempfile`

- Type: `List[str]`

#### hash_method

The algorithm to hash the files. Available options: "xxh128", "sha256"

- [`"xxh128"`](https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash): A extremely fast, high-quality 128bit non-cryptographic hash algorithm. 
  Recommend to use, unless you want theoretic extreme safety on hackers
- [`"sha256"`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2): A cryptographically secure and widely used 256bit hash algorithm.
  It's slower than xxh128, but the speed is acceptable enough with modern hardware


!!! danger

    You **CANNOT** change the `hash_method` after the plugin is enabled. Make your choice wisely

    If you do want to change the `hash_method`, you need to delete the `prime_backup.db` file and the `blobs` folder in the [storage root](#storage_root),
    which will delete all existing backups

- Type: `str`
- Default: `"xxh128"`

#### compress_method

The method to compress files stored in a backup

| Compress Method | Description                                                                                                                                                   | Speed | Compress rate |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|---------------|
| `plain`         | No compression, copy the file directly                                                                                                                        | ★★★★★ | ☆             |
| `gzip`          | The [gzip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/gzip.html) library based on [zlib](https://www.zlib.net/). The format same as a `.gz` file                       | ★★    | ★★★★          |
| `lzma`          | The [LZMA](https://docs.python.org/3/library/lzma.html) algorithm. The same format as a `.xz` file. Provides the best compression, but the speed is very slow | ☆     | ★★★★★         |
| `zstd`          | The [Zstandard](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) algorithm. A good balance between speed and compression rate. Recommend to  use                             | ★★★☆  | ★★★★          |
| `lz4`           | The [LZ4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4) algorithm. Faster than Zstandard, and even much faster in decompression, but with a lower compression rate              | ★★★★  | ★★☆           |

!!! warning

    Changing `compress_method` will only affect new files in new backups (i.e., new blobs)

!!! note

    If you want to use `lz4` as the compress method, you need to install the lz4 python library manually

    ```bash
    pip3 install lz4
    ```

- Type: `str`
- Default: `"zstd"`

#### compress_threshold

For files with a size less than the `compress_threshold`, no compression will be applied. They will be stored in the `plain` format.

!!! warning

    Changing `compress_threshold` will only affect new files in new backups (i.e., new blobs)

- Type: int
- Default: `64`

---

### Scheduled backup config

Configuration of the scheduled backup feature from Prime Backup

It's for creating a backup periodically and automatically for your server

```json
{
    "enabled": false,
    "interval": "12h",
    "crontab": null,
    "jitter": "10s",
    "reset_timer_on_backup": true,
    "require_online_players": false
}
```

#### enabled, interval, crontab, jitter

See the [crontab job setting](#crontab-job-setting) section

#### reset_timer_on_backup

If the schedule timer should be reset on each manual backup

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `true`

#### require_online_players

If set to `true`, automated backups will only occur when players are present on the server.

Note: This feature requires the Prime Backup plugin to be loaded before the server starts. 
If the Prime Backup plugin is loaded while the server is running, 
the scheduled backup feature will be disabled unless the [MinecraftDataAPI](https://github.com/MCDReforged/MinecraftDataAPI) plugin is present

Since Prime Backup supports file deduplication and highly customizable [prune config](#prune-config),
having backups even when no player is on the server will not result in excessive space usage

- Type: `bool`
- Default: `false`

---

### Prune config

The backup prune feature from Prime Backup enables automatically backup cleanup for the backup storage

```json
{
    "enabled": true,
    "interval": "3h",
    "crontab": null,
    "jitter": "20s",
    "timezone_override": null,
    "regular_backup": {
        "enabled": false,
        "max_amount": 0,
        "max_lifetime": "0s",
        "last": -1,
        "hour": 0,
        "day": 0,
        "week": 0,
        "month": 0,
        "year": 0
    },
    "pre_restore_backup": {
        "enabled": true,
        "max_amount": 10,
        "max_lifetime": "30d",
        "last": -1,
        "hour": 0,
        "day": 0,
        "week": 0,
        "month": 0,
        "year": 0
    }
}
```

It contains 2 prune settings for 2 kinds of backups:

- `regular_backup`: For regular backups, i.e. not pre-restore backups
- `pre_restore_backup`: For pre-restore backups

Each prune settings describes the retain policy in detailed

Prime Backup use the following steps to decide what to delete and what to retain:

1. Use [`last`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month`, `year`](#last-hour-day-week-month-year) to filter out backups to be deleted / retained
2. Use `max_amount` and `max_lifetime` to filter out those old and expired backups from the to-be-retained backups from step 1
3. Collected those to-be-deleted backups from the 2 steps above, delete them one by one

#### max_amount

Defines the maximum number of backups to keep, e.g. `10` means to keep a maximum of 10 of the latest backups

Set it to `0` for unlimited

- Type: `int`

#### max_lifetime

Defines the maximum retention duration for all backups. Backups exceeding this duration will be pruned and deleted.

Set it to `0s` for no time limit

- Type: [`Duration`](#duration)

#### last, hour, day, week, month, year

A set of [PBS](https://pbs.proxmox.com/)-style prune options, to describe how backups are deleted/retained

See the [prune simulator](https://pbs.proxmox.com/docs/prune-simulator/) for more explanations on these options

The [prune simulator](https://pbs.proxmox.com/docs/prune-simulator/) can also be used to simulate the retain policy

Notes: Value `0` means no retention on this period; Value `-1` means unlimited backups can be retained on this period, equivalent to setting to a very large value

- Type: `int`

---

#### enabled, interval, crontab, jitter

See the [crontab job setting](#crontab-job-setting) section

#### timezone_override

An optional timezone override during the prune calculation. By default (`null` value), Prime Backup will use the local timezone

Example values: `null`, `"Asia/Shanghai"`, `"US/Eastern"`, `"Europe/Amsterdam"`

- Type: `Optional[str]`
- Default: `null`

---

### Database config

Configurations for the SQLite database, used by Prime Backup

```json
{
    "compact": {
        "enabled": true,
        "interval": "1d",
        "crontab": null,
        "jitter": "5m"
    },
    "backup": {
        "enabled": true,
        "interval": "7d",
        "crontab": null,
        "jitter": "10m"
    }
}
```

Subconfig `compact` and `backup` describe the crontab jobs on the database

#### compact

The database compact job

It performs the [VACUUM](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html) command on the database, to compact the database file and free up unused space

#### backup

The database backup job

By default, Prime Backup creates backups for the database in the `db_backup` directory
within the [storage root](#storage_root) periodically, just in case something wrong happens

Database backups are stored with the `.tar.xz` format, and won't take up much space

#### enabled, interval, crontab, jitter

See the [crontab job setting](#crontab-job-setting) section

---

## Subconfig types

### crontab job setting

Setting of a crontab job to describe when the job executes. There are 2 valid mode

- interval mode: Execute the job at given time interval. The first execution also has to wait for the given interval
- crontab mode: Execute the job at specific time, described by a crontab string

If the job is enabled, you must choose one of the above modes and set the related config values correctly

```json
// Example
{
    "enabled": true,
    "interval": "1h",
    "crontab": null,
    "jitter": "10s"
}
```

#### enabled

The switch for the job. Set to  `true` to enable the crontab job; Set to `false` to disable the crontab job

- Type: `bool`

#### interval

Used in interval mode. The time interval between 2 jobs

It should be `null` if the job is not in interval mode

- Type: `Optional[str]`

#### crontab

Used in crontab mode. The crontab string

You can use [https://crontab.guru/](https://crontab.guru/) to create a crontab string

It should be `null` if the job is not in crontab mode

- Type: `Optional[str]`

#### jitter

The jitter between 2 scheduled backup jobs

The actual execution time for the next job will be shifted randomly with `[-jitter, +jitter]`

Set it to `"0s"` for no jitter

- Type: `str`

---

## Special value types

### Duration

Describes a time duration length with a string, e.g. `"3s"`, `"15m"`

A Duration consists of two parts: the number, and the time unit.

For the number part, it can be an integer, or a float

For the unit part, see the following table:

| Unit           | Description | Equals to    | Value in seconds |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| `ms`           | millisecond | 0.001 second | 0.001            |
| `s`, `sec`     | second      | 1 second     | 1                |
| `m`, `min`     | minute      | 60 seconds   | 60               |
| `h`, `hour`    | hour        | 60 minutes   | 3600             |
| `d`, `day`     | day         | 24 hours     | 86400            |
| `mon`, `month` | month       | 30 days      | 2592000          |
| `y`, `year`    | year        | 365 days     | 31536000         |
